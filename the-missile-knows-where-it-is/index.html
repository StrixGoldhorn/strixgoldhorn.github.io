    The missile knows where it is at all times<br />
    It knows this because it knows where it isn't<br />
    By subtracting where it is from where it isn't,<br />
    or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater),<br />
    it obtains a difference, or deviation<br />
    The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where
    it is to a position where it isn't,<br />
    and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is<br />
    Consequently, the position where it is,<br />
    is now the position that it wasn't,<br />
    and it follows that the position that it was,<br />
    is now the position that it isn't<br />
    In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a
    variation,<br />
    the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't<br />
    If variation is considered to be a significant factor,<br />
    it too may be corrected by the GEA<br />
    However, the missile must also know where it was<br />
    The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows<br />
    Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained,<br />
    it is not sure just where it is<br />
    However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was<br />
    It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa,<br />
    and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was,<br />
    it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error
